# FCC---Basic-JavaScript

## Understanding Basic JavaScript

- I will be going through the Basic JavaScript course on freeCodeCamp and documenting parts and concepts that I find difficult to comprehend.

### JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures - Stand in Line

- Write a function 'nextInLine' which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.
- Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.
  - Use .push to add the number to the end of the array, and use .shift to remove the first element of the array.
  
- The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed.
  - Assign a const variable for arr.shift() as removed to store the removed number, then return the removed variable.
